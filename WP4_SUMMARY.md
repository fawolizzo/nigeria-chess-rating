## Tournament Workflow

### Tournament Creation Flow

1. **Draft Creation** - TO creates tournament in draft status
2. **Player Addition** - TO adds players (existing or new) to tournament
3. **Tournament Activation** - TO activates tournament (requires ≥2 players)
4. **Round 1 Generation** - TO generates Swiss pairings for Round 1
5. **Public Visibility** - Tournament and pairings visible to public

### Player Management Flow

- **Search Existing** - Type-ahead search of active players
- **Add Player** - Add with appropriate seed rating based on tournament format
- **Create New** - Create pending player and add to tournament
- **Validation** - Prevent duplicate registrations and invalid additions

### Swiss Pairing Logic

- **Top/Bottom Half** - Players ranked by seed rating, paired across halves
- **Bye Assignment** - Lowest-rated player gets bye if odd number
- **Board Numbers** - Sequential board numbering from highest to lowest rated pairings
