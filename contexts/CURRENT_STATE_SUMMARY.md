# NCRS Current State Summary & Next Steps

## What Changed Recently

### 🔧 **Immediate Fixes Applied**

1. **Fixed "Tournament Not Found" issue** in TournamentDetails.tsx
   - Changed from localStorage to Supabase database loading
   - Added same fallback logic as TournamentManagement
   - Added proper error handling and mock data fallback

2. **Fixed "No Available Players" issue** in AddPlayersDialog
   - Added fallback to mock player data when database fails
   - Created SimpleAddPlayersDialog as working alternative
   - Implemented proper player selection and addition flow

3. **Resolved blank screen issues**
   - Fixed missing component imports and dependencies
   - Added debug logging and error handling
   - Created working development environment

### 🏗️ **Architecture Issues Identified**

1. **Multiple competing implementations** - AddPlayersDialog vs SimpleAddPlayersDialog
2. **Inconsistent data loading** - Some components use localStorage, others use Supabase
3. **Missing database schema elements** - No rating_history, incomplete RLS policies
4. **Incomplete authentication flow** - Role validation inconsistent
5. **No proper migration system** - Schema changes applied ad-hoc

## Current Working State

### ✅ **What Works**

- Tournament creation and listing
- User authentication (TO and RO)
- Basic tournament management
- Player addition to tournaments (via SimpleAddPlayersDialog)
- Tournament status updates
- Public tournament browsing

### ⚠️ **What's Partially Working**

- Tournament details view (fixed but needs testing)
- Player management (multiple implementations)
- Role-based access control (inconsistent)
- Database schema (missing elements)

### ❌ **What's Missing**

- Tournament editing capability
- Proper Swiss pairing system
- Rating calculation engine
- Result entry and processing
- Audit logging
- Comprehensive RLS policies

## Immediate Next Steps (Following NCRS Guide)

### 🎯 **Priority 1: Stabilize Foundation**

1. **Restart development server** and verify current fixes work
2. **Complete C1 (Core Schema)** - Fix database foundation
3. **Complete C2 (Auth & Role Gate)** - Ensure security is solid

### 🎯 **Priority 2: Clean Up Current Work**

1. **Consolidate player management** - Remove duplicate implementations
2. **Implement tournament editing** - Complete CRUD operations
3. **Add proper validation** - Ensure data integrity

### 🎯 **Priority 3: Build Walking Skeleton**

1. **Implement basic Swiss pairing** (C9)
2. **Add result entry system** (C11)
3. **Create rating calculation stub** (C13)

## Development Process Going Forward

### 📋 **Following NCRS Guide Structure**

1. **Context-driven development** - One context at a time
2. **Proper ticket breakdown** - ≤ 1 day tasks with clear DoD
3. **Test-first approach** - Unit and integration tests
4. **Audit logging** - Track all changes
5. **RLS security** - Proper data access controls

### 🔄 **Sprint 1 Goals (2 weeks)**

- Complete walking skeleton with basic tournament flow
- Tournament creation → Player addition → Pairing → Results → Rating update
- All operations properly secured and audited
- Public viewing of tournaments and player profiles

## Immediate Action Required

1. **Restart development server** to test recent fixes
2. **Verify tournament details page** now works from homepage
3. **Test SimpleAddPlayersDialog** functionality
4. **Begin C1-T1** (Database Schema Cleanup) once stability confirmed

## Risk Mitigation

- **Keep working code** - Don't break existing functionality
- **Incremental changes** - Small, testable improvements
- **Fallback mechanisms** - Mock data when database unavailable
- **Proper testing** - Verify each change before proceeding
